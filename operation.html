    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>This extension allows you to print scores from flat.io without branding and with any number of parts. To use, open your score on flat. Use the instruments option to display only certain scores. Scroll down to the bottom of the score to make sure the entire score is loaded. Only the loaded parts will be passed to the extension for printing. Press the print button in the edit menu. An option should be labeled <b>Print with Chrome Extension</b>. Click that. The extension should open a page with a copy of the loaded score and should start the print dialogue. You may want to adjust the scale to make sure everything is shown.</p>
